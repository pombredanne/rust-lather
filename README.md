# Installation Instructions

This project requires Rust 1.30 or newer. If you do not have a Rust compiler, they are easily available from [rustup.rs](rustup.rs). With a suitable Rust compiler, clone the project then run `python setup.py install` inside the source directory.

To update, `git pull` then `python setup.py install --force`.

The MSVC compiler(s) and linker are sufficiently hard to operate that this basically requires Anaconda to be installed on Windows.
